"""Contains a list of inputs and outputs that OSCAR recognizes, as well as application groups and settings.

    Responses
    ---------
    The responses list is a list of all responses OSCAR has to choose from.
    Generally speaking, there are five responses for each possible situation, although the number varies.
    Responses are indexed in a specific order, which OSCAR uses to call them.
    This system may be deprecated in the future, and replaced with a cleaner OOP solution.
    The string may contain a token to be replaced in the string that the user sees, such as <user>.
    There is no fixed list of these, they may be any token that you wish. The only requirement is that
    you use the same token that you pass to oscar_functions.get_response()

    Inputs
    ------
    The inputs list is a list of regex strings that OSCAR recognizes as inputs for a given command.
    This system will be deprecated in later versions, and replaced with a machine learning driven
    classification algorithm. However, for the moment, the system relies on this input list.
    It is important to note that if you do not want the input to call a given function,
    you may simply pass 0 as the method to be called.

    Structure
    ---------
    [
        [
            <A list of strings that OSCAR associates with this category>
        ],
        [
            <A list of strings that the system commonly mislabels as this category>
            If any of these substrings are found in the user input string, OSCAR will not
            label the input as this category.
        ],
        <Method to be called>
    ]

    Settings
    --------
    A list of settings that the user can configure to customize OSCAR. It adheres to the following structure
    [
        name : string
            The name that the user wishes to be addressed by
        clock type : int
            The clock type that the user wishes to use. 0 = 24 hour, 1 = 12 hour
        file location method : int
            The method that the user wants OSCAR to use to prompt them for file locations.
            0 = just let the user type it out, 1 = give them a file explorer window
    ]

    Groups
    ------
    A list that houses the programs that the user has told OSCAR about, and their respective aliases, as well as groups.

    "Groups" are sets of applications that OSCAR associates with particular phrases or words

        Structure
        ---------
